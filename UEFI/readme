Frankly speaking, Hi12 firmware is a piece of crap. Among other numerous issues, particularly in ACPI tables, it has following boot-related ones:
	* doesn't respect BootOrder var, just resets it to hardcoded value on each reboot
	* has a bad habit of resetting EFI boot entries to fw-hardcoded ones from time to time, wiping all custom entries added by user
	* uses removable media path for android boot loader, which is just bad design
	
For now I'm going the simplest route possible:
	* disabling stock OSSelection menu via BootSelectVariable-944fb13b-773f-4cbb-9c6f-326cebde4c23, and setting it to always boot "Android-IA", which is hardcoded to /EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi
	* moving actual android bootloader to another location and adding an entry for it into rEFInd menu
	* moving rEFIng binary in place of android loader, to be executed by default
	* patching rEFInd so that volume up/down keys are treated as left/right
	
	
ESP dir represents my current ESP part contents just for convenience.
rEFInd binary is 0.11.0 volkeys-patched & built on gnu-efi
